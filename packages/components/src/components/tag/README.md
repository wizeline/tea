# wz-tag
## Description
I would like to have a tag component that supports:
- many design systems color scheme (primary, positive, secondary, info, negatie, warning)
- checked state
- removable state

## DEVX
### Default
```

<wz-tag>
  This is a tag
</wz-tag>

[ This is a tag ]
```
### Color scheme

> primary | info | warning | negative | positive
```
<wz-tag info >
  This is a tag
</wz-tag>

[ This is a tag ] // imagine it has color
```
