**Wizeline Tea** is a design system created to ease, accelerate and standardize
designs for HTML interfaces that are developed under the Wizeline brand.

As a developer or a designer, you can use these custom components to: 

- Create a consistent user experience across Wizelineâ€™s virtual environments.  
- Make their designs scalable and systematical.
- Expedite prototyping and testing processes. 

You may, as well, add components to the [design system](https://github.com/wizeline/tea).
